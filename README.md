# Real-Time-Temperature-Humidity-Detector
The real-time temperature and humidity detector is a portable device created with an STM32 development board, DHT11 sensor, and OLED display. 
A Real-time temperature and humidity detector using an STM32 development board, DHT11 sensor, and an OLED display is a great project. Here's a basic outline to help you get started:

Components needed:
STM32 development board (e.g., STM32F103C8T6)
DHT11 sensor
OLED display (e.g., SSD1306)
Jumper wires
Breadboard
Power source (USB cable or battery)
